# OWL (Open Windowing Library)
## OWL is intended to be a simple, multiplatform windowing library, based on Xlib, WinAPI and (maybe) Cocoa.
## OWL will of course support Direct3D, OpenGL and Vulkan. :D

*Supports:*
- Xlib
	- Software graphics
	- OpenGL graphics
- WinAPI
	- Software graphics
	- OpenGL graphics

If you wish to see the examples working, simply head over to the `build` directory and use `make`.
```
cd build
make
```
This will result in (at least one of) the examples compiling into a binary.
